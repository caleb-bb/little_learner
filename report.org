* Review of The Little Learner
The Little Learner is a book on deep learning. This is a summary of The Little Learner.

** Scheme, Lisp, and Functional Programming: Why And How

** Linear Equations For Deep Learning
*** From lines to neurons
*** Target functions

** WTF Is A Tensor?

*** This is what an effing tensor is
*** Extending operations to tensors
See Interlude V for some of this
*** Shape

** Approximation In Deep Learning
*** Successive Approximation
*** Gradients

** Hyperparameters
*** WTF is a hyper parameter and why do we have them?
*** How do we implement them in the context of Scheme and functional programming more generally?

** Gradient Descent
*** The Skeleton Of Gradient Descent
*** Problems With Gradient Descent (and solutions thereto)
See Chapters 8 and 9 + Interlude IV for some of this

** Neurons To Layers
